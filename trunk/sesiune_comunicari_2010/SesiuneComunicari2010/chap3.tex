\label{sec:results}

The next step we have to take towards completing the argumentation mining module of the agents consists of extracting argumentation schemes from natural text. Our approach will use a SVM classifier trained on AraucariaDB corpus with features like the position of sentence in the text, the tense of main verb, the most probable argumentative category of previous and next sentences or argumentative patterns to split argumentative propositions into premises and conclusions. Those sentences will then be integrated into higher level structures using the schemes define by Walton in \cite{walton1996argumentation}.
